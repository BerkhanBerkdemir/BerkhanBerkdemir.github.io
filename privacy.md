## HTTPS Always

I don't know why but there are thosands of websites which you have to connect
without secure HTTP connection. This is not the one. You may ask yourself
*why?* is this part of this page. You will not get Man in the Middle Attacks
:tada:

## Analytics

I really don't care how many traffic I get. So, no analytic tool in this
website.

### No Cookies

I can draw no cookie website picture

```ruby
def cookie_in_site?
  # assume no_analytic is true
  true if no_analytic
end
```
