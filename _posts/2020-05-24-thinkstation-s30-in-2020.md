title: ThinkStation S30 in 2020

2 weeks ago I finally bought a workstation to do some crazy renderings and make
a *play station*. I was initially planning to build a system and started with
ordering an AMD A12-9800 CPU[^1]. However, I then realized build going to be
expensive.

I decided to buy a complete solution--like a desktop. On eBay, there are
hundreds of 5-10 years old computers selling under $500 price range. I also
looked at Apple Mac but because of the branding and the operating system, I
couldn't find great deals.

Many of my friends know that I am **obsessed** with IBM Think products so Lenovo
--F*** you! I also worked with Dell workstations and HP workstations/servers.
However, I couldn't find myself into buying a Dell workstation even tough I
already managed 1 in the office. I didn't like their BIOS or driver/update
delivery method. HP BIOS/driver updates was always "looks easy but actually
hard", so I ordered this, ThinkStation S30, beauty.

The machine came with

* Intel Xeon E5 2609
* 4x 4 GB DDR3 ECC RAM
* NVIDIA Quadro K400
* 650W Gold Power Supplier

Of course, you first ask yourself how much would this setup be and where is the
harddrive. I only paid $126 (of course +10% tax) with free shipping and I also
ordered 1 TB Seagate Barracuda, thermal paste (because the machine is 7 years
old), Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 470.

I tried to run the system with K400 for a few days but can't handle normal
games like CS: GO, League of Legends but was OK in Blender3D. The interesting
anecdote I'd like to share is that the device is hotter than hell. It can easily
reach to 70Â°C.

I don't like to say, but you should also try this 7-year old machine. It still
wants to run 24-hour render on it! Wort to mention that I bought machine type
0569[^2]. This means I have limited CPU option and plan to have a 8 core
[Xeon E5-2670][ark-e5-2670]. It's just $40 range on ebay and I can sell the old one in the same range,
funnily.

Oh. Sadly, I am running Windows 10 and it **sucks**! Wish to use Windows 7
