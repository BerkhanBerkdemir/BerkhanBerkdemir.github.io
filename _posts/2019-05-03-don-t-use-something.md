What a powerful a group of words **Don't Use**, and as a developer/sysadmin,
I hear/read that a lot in a blog post or a conversation. Today, I heard these
words in a Slack channel about MongoDB.

> Don't use MongoDB.
>
> &mdash; [FILTERED]

Of course, I believe sharing is important. That's why I write
[Mağara][magara] which is licensed with GNU AGPLv3. I love
writing blog posts since I love exchanging my experience with other bloggers.

However, I **do not** understand why people blame a project/service/product that
does not suit their project/service/product.

## What should we do?

Use these group of words instead of **Don't use**

* Don't use since the application that you develop requires high read & write.
  You can achieve with optimizing with an X way, but Lorem tool provides that
  out of the box. I prefer you to use Lorem tool with the Y configuration.
* Don't use because it seems easy to manage that X tool, but behind the scene
  you need to worry about A, B, and C.

## Extra: Example, Inc. Company

Big players make developer think about their tool-stacks, and some of them
provide these tools under open-source licenses, for example
[Kubernetes][kubernetes] or [Liquid][liquid] template language. These tools are
written for their software requirements.

Chris Wanstrath, the founder of GitHub, write about why they are using
[Unicorn][unicorn!], a Ruby application server. In the conclusion part, he says
something important for developers who read the article.

> **Use what works best for you**. Decide what you need and evaluate the
> available options based on those needs. **Don’t pick a tool because GitHub
> uses it**, **pick a tool because it solves the problems you have**.
>
> &mdash; Chris Wanstrath [October 9, 2009][unicorn!]

## Conclusion

Please **do not** say only **don't use something** instead explain why you
should not use it in your project. Therefore, we can keep
a project/services/product usable and dynamic.
