I was taking Intel x86 assembly class in this Spring, and a friend of mine,
@BartuMutlu, did a mistake in a quiz section about *"How many asm instructions
are needed"*.

After the quiz 11, I naturally said, in Turkish, a sentence that is title of this
post

> Emin olduğun şeyden emin olmadığından emin ol

or

> Be make sure you are not sure that you are sure

I could develop other ideas with this quote, but I wanted to share only the
quote.
