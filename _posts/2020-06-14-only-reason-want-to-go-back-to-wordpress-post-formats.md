[Post Formats][pf] rock! Why? Because make the blog post smooth. It is like a
social media. You just don't see one kind of post. There are some videos, links 
or slides.

I think I can the same thing in here--without WordPress. I always want to see
some "Quote", "Link", "Aside".

Then, why would I use a social media account if WordPress gave us this for free?
