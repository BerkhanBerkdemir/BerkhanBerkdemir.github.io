![Screenshot I took from Android which Google Maps notifies that I better install offline map of Istanbul](/public/images/2020/6/2-g-maps-welcomes-me-before-my-parents.png)

I was waiting for a "Hi" from my parents, cousins or friends. They can't access
my e-mail to know when or where I am going. However, Google can do, and they are
preparing my Istanbul visit. Thank you(!)

## Story

I asked my parents to not send any e-mails to that e-mail address. They sent the
flight ticket. Even though I have disabled all "personalized \<insert noun>"
settings, I got this lovely notification 4 days before my flight.

Will I add to this? No. People who can use *brain* shall choice the right path.

Thank you.
