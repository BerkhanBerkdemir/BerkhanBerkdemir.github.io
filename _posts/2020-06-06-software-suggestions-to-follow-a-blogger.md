You may be asked yourself earlier that you have a handful of bloggers you like,
but you don't how to notify yourself when they have a new post.

This was actually solved with RSS and Atom feeds. In this post, I will not show
how to follow one of them but suggest list of software to follow those bloggers.

I don't like to share freemium or proprietary software, but rather, I'll try to
show both self-hosted servers or client-only software.

Also, you can follow this blog with using any of these software adding RSS which
you can find under this post in the footer.

## Liferea

Before everything else, I started with this lovely, simple and GNOME-first RSS
application. It just works; however, it doesn't good at notifying things. I
have to go in there and start the application to see what is new.

It is actually a good thing since you don't get distracted with all the
notifications.

## Feeder

This is where I started to use in Android. It is just simple and to point
application. No Need PhD&trade;. I downloaded from [F-Droid][feeder] as an APK.

## TinyTinyRSS

TinyTinyRSS is one of the well known system. It is self-hosted PHP application.
I just started to using it on my home server. There is client needed, if you are
OK with web interface--which is simple and smooth.

That option is more advance and if you still want to do it, there are plenty of
documentation, blog posts available.

## Conclusion

I would say this is how I follow people. This can be vary for your bloggers. You
can also use freemium software services, but for me, I just don't like to host
things I can.
