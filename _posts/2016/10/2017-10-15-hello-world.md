Hi guys,

You can check the link if you want simple blog site.
This software builds with powerful [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

So this website about programming, [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), server-system, in sort of about computer maybe photographing and electronic music. I don't know.

You can contact with my website (actually you are looking the website) [GitHub](https://berkhanberkdemir.github.io), and pull request this blog. This website protect with CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike) which is license.

This license means you can copy my article or content which have to write `Licensed with CC BY-SA` but than you MUST write my name and article / content URL in your article / post. If you want to help about that just notify me.

So license stuff and what I will write here I think OK..
