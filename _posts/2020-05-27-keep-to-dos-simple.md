Maybe you also realized bilions of to-do apps available on web or smartphone
market. I tried many of them (Evernote, Samsung Memo, Notion, [Tasks][tasks]),
but could not find the near-perfect solution. I stepped back and manage by hand
some tasks with in Vi. I was impressed with the reasult and wanted improve. So,
found [Todotxt][todoxt]. I highly recomend the way it is designed--has missing
features. I am using [this][todotxt-web] web view from Jason Holt, @bicarbon8.
