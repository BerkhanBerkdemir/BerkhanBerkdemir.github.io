Do you wanna say something? Here is the recipe for it. I am using Signal and
associated with my phone number. If you have both Signal and my phone number
you can contact me any time.

If you just don't want to install yet another application but want to use more
simple thing, I have e-mail solution. You can shoot e-mail to firstnamelastname
at protonmail dot com. This e-mail is just new and can be change anytime soon.
You can see that change in this page when I do.

I also can send you [Jitsi][jitsi] link via e-mail if you want to use something
similar to awful Zoom.

If you don't want to use any of these methods, I am sorry for now.
