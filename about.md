Welcome misafir[^1]!

I've been writing posts since November 2015 about Linux, FOSS, bare-metal
servers and cloud computing. If you are addicted to FOSS, follow me with the RSS
link, and if you know Turkish, follow a blog that is called
[Linux KafasÄ±](https://www.linuxkafasi.org).

## Coding

Started with Python 3 with reading a book about **Programming with Python** in
early 2014[^2]. The book was published in Turkish; therefore, I have missing
knowledge about terminology of programming especially object oriented
programming. I moved on PHP since I didn't work with Django &mdash; I didn't
even set it up on my MS Windows computer. At the same time, I opened a GitHub
account because everybody is using it, and I was curious. Failed a few times
when I want to contribute some repository like a new kid on the block.

I met with Ruby after PHP and Symfony because of Ruby on Rails, and I fell in
love with it due to its **Don't Repeat Yourself** principle. After that moment,
I started to look Docker and Kubernetes, and I use them in production for my
open-source projects.

I've taken C++ and Assembly (x86) classes in college and completed them with
high grades (> 90%).

### Too Long; Didn't Read

I use Ruby.

### Extra: When I say "It s*cks"?

I hate to be unfair since I know that developing something is not easy as piece
of cake; therefore, I hate to say "it s*cks". For example, I hate to write
JavaScript because:

* Official name is EcmaScript. Heck? So, why aren't we call EcmaScript?
* Browser version of JavaScript != Server version of JavaScript
* Everybody runs their own JavaScript implementation and style guide
* Weird things &mdash; [JavaScript, The Weird Parts by Minko Gechev][js-weird]
  ```javascript
  1 == 1; // true
  'foo' == 'foo'; // true
  [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]; // false
  ```

*P.S. I know these questions' answers; as a result, I hate JavaScript et al.*

## Amateur photographer

Well, I don't share photographs that I took on a social media account, but I'll
leave some of them in here
