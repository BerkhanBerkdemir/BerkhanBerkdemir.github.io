Hi Web users,

This week I planned to **start** a new series: news! Well, sounds like *cool*,
right? The main reason is this will be exist because I don't have enough time to
write long weblogs. Also, I'd like to keep these news short, so you can read
these Monday mornings :scream:

In the next week's news, I will try to collect more links and not just *news*
link.
