Hello dear Web users,

I am one day late for this newsletter but I will keep this newsletter anyway. I
had a crazy Friday night. I didn't want to make this newsletter crazy long. So,
I skipped some of the event I cared.

## Life

* [Amazon Isnâ€™t the Only Shop Online][amazon-is-the-only-shop]  
    I'm sorry but have you ever tried any other service like InstaCart or
    DoorDash in LA? Non of these have a strong believes about customer-first
    obsesion. I am not saying thanks to being a Primer member. Instead, just try
    to be an problem solver.
* [PayPal and Venmo don't have solution for "SIM Swap Hackers"][swap-n-hack]  
    Funny because these companies still sending reset passwords as
    **plain text** via SMS. Also, we know that they want to *balance* between
    security and scalability.
* [Microsoft Buys Corp.com So Bad Guys Can't][corp-dot-com]  
    That is kind of scarry. I heard why? Because already people using corp.com
    in their default Active Directory configuration, it makes the problem worst.
    I think $1.7M is good price tag, but could this problem not be solved in a
    different way?
* [Universities are having hard time without foreign students][aybabtu]  
    I think the same situation also applied to colleges. My college (Santa
    Monica College) also *loves* their international students~~'s pocket~~.
    [All your base are belong to us][wiki-aybabtu].
* [1M COVID-19 testing capacity; just in the US][covid-billion]
* [G bans Zoom from employees' computer][g-bans-zoom]
* [Zoom sued for overstating, not disclosing privacy flaws][zoom-sued]

## Edu

* [CS 241: System Programming][cs241-sys-programming]  
    I didn't read the whole book but read just a few sections. I really like the    work. It is in masterpiece status. If you are trying to figure out how the
    internal system of an operating system, that is the book you want to check
    out.
* [G SRE Book: Building Secure and Reliable Systems][g-sre-book]
    I really like this landing page. What is funny is that *webmasters* placed
    [wrong `Content-Type`][g-sre-book-hn-comment].

## Tech

* [Announcing the Compose Specification][compose-spec]  
    That is **late** move but "better late than never", right? [**Awesome**
    repository][awr] includes great examples to look what compose is capable of.
    This move is so obvious that they want to be part of the Kubernetes
    community--which is great for both community.
* [Jitsi Meet features update][jitsi-is-killin]
* [Rules for Data Modeling with DynamoDB][dynamodb-tricks]
    The blog post talks about why you should change your mindset when developing
    an application on top of DynamoDB. Author gives an example of how you
    should develop with spreadsheets.
* [Cloudflare's move from reCAPTCHA to hCAPTCHA][for-hcaptcha]
    Just one question. Did Cloudflare only use reCAPTCHA because of it was
    offered for free? Customers were treated like a product to train G's model.
    That is not fair.
